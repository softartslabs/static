<!-- Interests -->
  <h2>Interests</h2>

  <p><strong>IoT / Wearable:</strong> I am interested in Internet of Things, IoT devices can connect people to technology automatically.</p>

  <p><strong>Automation:</strong> I enjoy automating everything for my collegue and me. It reduces our time when doing repetitive tasks and could make our life more meaningful.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Life logging:</strong> I gather many kinds of sensor-based personal data such my GPS location. My location is being gathered all day even when I am not aware. This reminds me of forgotten memories. (You can search my location history here, by the way. &lt;<a href="http://mylife.softarts.co.kr" target="_blank">http://mylife.softarts.co.kr</a>&gt;). I hope technology could remind of our forgotten memories someday.
